A flower wilts one petal at a time

The way the past grows dimmer by the day

And once a memory sheds its youth

Upon a mortician’s table, where we lay

the hollow husks of things to be dissected,

we find that the pithy touch of lips has fled,

once sweet rose blush has soured to grey,

and sounds repeated over are now dead.

The memory becomes a tapestry

Of patches—fragments torn from the mind

And knit together with prolific subtlety

To hang in dusty halls beyond mention.

And yet we know this thing belongs to us,

This ill-fated memory wilted thus.
