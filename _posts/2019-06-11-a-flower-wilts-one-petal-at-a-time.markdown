A flower wilts one petal at a time<br>
The way the past grows dimmer by the day<br>
And once a memory sheds its youth <br>
Upon a mortician’s table, where we lay<br>
the hollow husks of things to be dissected,<br>
we find that the pithy touch of lips has fled,<br>
once sweet rose blush has soured to grey,<br>
and sounds repeated over are now dead.<br>
The memory becomes a tapestry<br>
Of patches—fragments torn from the mind<br>
And knit together with prolific subtlety<br> 
To hang in dusty halls beyond mention.<br>
And yet we know this thing belongs to us,<br>
This ill-fated memory wilted thus.<br>
